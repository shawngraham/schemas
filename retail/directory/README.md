# Restaurant Information Management Schema

## Background

In the hospitality industry, especially in food services, detailed and accessible information about restaurants enhances customer experiences and business operations. A structured schema for managing and presenting restaurant data can greatly benefit potential customers, review platforms, and marketing efforts.

## Scenario

Consider a scenario where a new food review platform is being developed, and there is a need to organize information about various restaurants comprehensively. This schema will help in categorizing and displaying detailed information about each restaurant, including:

- Descriptions of the restaurantâ€™s ambiance and offerings.
- Specific dishes served.
- Operating hours for different days and meal times.
- Directions to the restaurant.
- Group accommodation capabilities.
