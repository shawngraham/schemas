# Employee Information Management Schema

## Background

For organizations and HR departments, managing candidate information efficiently is crucial during the recruitment process. A structured schema to handle resume data can significantly enhance the ability to sort, search, and analyze candidate details quickly and effectively.

## Scenario

Imagine a scenario where a recruitment software is being developed to automate the sorting and preliminary analysis of candidate resumes. This schema allows for a standardized approach to capture and link various aspects of a resume such as personal details, job history, and educational background. It is designed to answer queries like:

- What is the contact information of the candidate?
- Which countries have candidates lived in?
- What job positions have candidates held and at which companies?
- During what years did candidates hold specific positions?
