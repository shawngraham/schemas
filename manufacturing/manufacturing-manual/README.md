# Roller Bearings Specifications Schema

## Background

In the engineering and manufacturing industries, especially in machinery design, having precise and accessible information on component specifications is critical. A schema that accurately maps the relationships between different bearing designs, components, materials, and specifications can enhance product development, quality control, and maintenance processes.

## Scenario

Consider an engineering database system used by mechanical engineers to select and specify spherical roller bearings for various applications. This schema would allow engineers to easily access detailed information about bearing designs, components, materials used, and technical specifications. Such a system can support queries like:

- What materials are used in specific bearing designs?
- Which components are included with certain bearing designs?
- How are specific bearings fitted or fixed in machinery?
