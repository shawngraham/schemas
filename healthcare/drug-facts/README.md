# Drug Facts Knowledge Graph Schema

## Background

In the field of pharma, there is an abundance of data available, ranging from clinical research, drug warning labels, patient records, etc. Building a knowledge graph using a schema can help organize and connect this data, enabling more efficient, structured analysis, discovery, and decision-making across various unstructured documents.

## Scenario

Imagine a scenario where a pharma company wants to build a chatbot for their customers to more easily and naturally explore the treatments, side effects, and other critical information about the drugs that they provide. They have a large database of drug fact documents in PDF format, and they want to use them to construct a medication knowledge graph to answer questions such as:

- Which drugs cause drowsiness?
- Which drugs contain a certain active ingredient?
- What does a particular medication treat?
