# Pain Management Patient Tracker Schema

## Background

In modern healthcare settings, effectively tracking patient treatments, outcomes, and plans is crucial for delivering personalized care. A schema designed to facilitate the systematic recording and analysis of these elements can significantly enhance the management of patient care, particularly in the field of pain management.

## Scenario

Consider a healthcare provider specializing in pain management who aims to monitor and adjust treatments based on individual patient responses. By implementing a schema-based system, the provider can not only record past treatments and their outcomes but also plan future medical interventions. Such a system can answer questions like:

- What treatments have been effective for a patient in managing pain?
- What are the observed outcomes after specific treatments?
- What are the planned future treatments for a patient?
