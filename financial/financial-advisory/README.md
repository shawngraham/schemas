# Financial Planning Client Schema

## Background

Effective financial planning is essential for helping clients meet their immediate needs and long-term goals. A detailed schema that encapsulates all aspects of a client's financial and personal life enables financial advisors to provide tailored advice and build robust financial strategies.

## Scenario

Imagine a financial advisory firm that uses a sophisticated schema to gather and analyze comprehensive data about their clients. This schema allows them to track clients' employment status, family details, financial accounts, assets, goals, and even personal interests. This information helps advisors offer personalized recommendations and ensure that every aspect of the client's financial life is considered. The schema can be utilized to answer queries such as:

- What financial assets does a client own?
- How do family dynamics influence a client's financial decisions?
- What are the short-term and long-term goals of the client?
