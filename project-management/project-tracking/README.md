# Project Management Information Schema

## Background

Effective project management relies heavily on detailed and structured information about projects, tasks, and associated elements such as team members and issues. A structured schema to organize and link this data can significantly enhance project tracking, reporting, and resource allocation in any organization.

## Scenario

Imagine a scenario where a project management tool is being developed to help teams efficiently track progress, resolve issues, and manage resources across multiple projects. This schema would provide a framework for mapping tasks to projects, assigning team members to tasks, and tracking the status and progress of each component. This facilitates queries such as:

- What are the tasks associated with a project?
- Who is responsible for resolving specific issues?
- What is the current status of tasks and projects?
